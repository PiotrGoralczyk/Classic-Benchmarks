  Overview
=============================================================================

This package accompanies the paper "The impact of RPython on VM design and
implementation" by Carl Friedrich Bolz and Laurence Tratt. It automates the
building and running of the experimental results therein, so that others can
reproduce the results and study them.

We have attempted to make this as automated as possible on Unix machines. We
recommend that the machine you run this on has at least 6Gb RAM (preferably
8Gb). You may need to install some background software, although the build
process does its best to detect this when started. The only piece of software
we can not easily automate the download of is Java: you will need to provide
your own Java VM (including javac) and put it into your $PATH.

In general you can simply execute:

  $ ./run-experiments.sh

This will build the necessary software (which takes approximately 1-2 hours)
and then run the experiments (which takes approximately 12-24 hours). If the
software has already been built, it will simply run the experiments.

When complete, you will see the results in the results/ directory.
